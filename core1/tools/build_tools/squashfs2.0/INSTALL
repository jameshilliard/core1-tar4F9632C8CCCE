			INSTALLING SQUASHFS

The squashfs2.0-ALPHA.tar.gz file contains this file, a README file,
an ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS file, a CHANGES file, the squashfs patch
directories/files, and the squashfs-tools directory (mksquashfs).

1. Patching the kernel
----------------------

There are seven kernel patch directories depending on your linux kernel version.
In each directory there are patches to provide squashfs2.0 alpha release
from a base kernel.  If your kernel version isn't listed then try the patch for
the nearest kernel listed.

To patch your kernel, cd into the top level directory, and run the "patch"
comand, e.g. assuming linux-2.4.20

%cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.20
%patch -p1 < location-of-squashfs/linux-2.4.20/squashfs2.0-patch

Where "location-of-squashfs" is the path to the squashfs2.0-ALPHA source directory.

The squashfs patches patch the relevant kernel files to add configure support,
initrd support, include files, and the squashfs directory under linux/fs/.
Once patched, the kernel must be reconfigured, with squashfs support turned on
(either Y/M) to ensure that inflate support is built into the kernel.  The
squashfs kernel option can be found in the filesystems submenu of the
configure menus.  In the 2.6.x kernels, the squashfs option is hiding in
the new miscellaneous filesystems submenu near the bottom of the filesystems
submenu.

2. Building squashfs tools
--------------------------

The squashfs-tools directory contains the mksquashfs program.  This can be
made by typing make.  The source files use a local copy of squashfs_fs.h
(included in the kernel patches) allowing the tools to be made without needing
to patch the kernel.  The program uses Large File Support
(64 bit offsets etc.) and so a relatively recent glibc is needed.
